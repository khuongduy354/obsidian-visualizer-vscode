type [[]] or []() should recommend to the user the most relevant file. 

upon enter it should create a link with fap (file absolute path).  



(i'm not sure if this is available or implemented correctly)
for already available file: 
if content is a link and the file does exist: choose that file. 

(the fap/link is unique anyway so no ambiguity) 

if the content only has a filename (no path) and multiple files with same name exist: choose the first one
